Overview:
Hangman is a classic word-guessing game where players attempt to discover a hidden word by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses. This implementation includes several enhancements to make the game more engaging and diverse. The enhancements include word categories, hangman graphics, difficulty levels, and the potential for multiplayer mode and a hint system.

Features:
1. Word Categories:
In traditional Hangman, words are randomly selected without any specific theme. In this implementation, word categories have been introduced to add variety and make the game more interesting. Players can choose from different categories such as animals, countries, and movies. This not only diversifies the gameplay but also allows players to focus on specific topics of interest.

2. Hangman Graphics:
A visual representation of the hangman has been added using ASCII art. As players make incorrect guesses, different parts of the hangman are revealed, creating a visual element to the game. This enhances the user experience by providing a graphical representation of the consequences of incorrect guesses.

3. Difficulty Levels:
The game offers different difficulty levels by adjusting the number of allowed incorrect guesses. Players can choose between easy, medium, and hard levels, each with a different maximum number of incorrect guesses allowed. Additionally, difficulty levels can be further customized by selecting longer words for higher difficulty.

Usage:
To play the game, users run the Python script and follow the on-screen prompts. They can choose a word category, make guesses, and attempt to discover the hidden word. The game provides feedback on correct and incorrect guesses and ultimately reveals the hidden word or ends the game if the maximum number of incorrect guesses is reached.

Conclusion:
This Hangman game implementation with enhancements offers an interactive and varied gaming experience. Players can enjoy the classic word-guessing challenge with added features such as word categories, hangman graphics, and difficulty levels. The modular code structure also allows for further customization and expansion, making it a versatile and enjoyable game for users.
